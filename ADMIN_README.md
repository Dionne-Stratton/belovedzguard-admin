## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20.19.0 or >=22.12.0 recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Access to the BelovedZGuard API

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Auth0 credentials:

```env
VITE_APP_PRODUCTION_SERVER_URL=https://belovedzguard-ebf890192e0e.herokuapp.com
VITE_APP_AUTH0_PROD_DOMAIN=your-auth0-domain.auth0.com
VITE_APP_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
VITE_APP_AUDIENCE=your-api-audience
```

4. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## Authentication Setup

### Auth0 Login

The admin panel uses Auth0 for authentication. When you first load the app:

1. Click the **"Sign In"** button in the top right
2. You'll be redirected to Auth0's login page
3. Enter your admin credentials
4. You'll be redirected back to the admin panel

The session is automatically maintained using Auth0's SDK.

See `AUTH0_SETUP.md` for detailed Auth0 configuration instructions.

{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "title": "string (required)",
  "genre": "string (required)",
  "description": "string (optional)",
  "verse": "string (optional)",
  "youTube": "string (optional)",

{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "title": "string (required)",
  "songs": ["ObjectId"] (optional, ordered array),
  "createdAt": "Date",
  "updatedAt": "Date"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Error loading songs/albums"

- Check if the API is running
- Verify the API_BASE_URL in your `.env` file
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

### "Admin access required" or 401 errors

- Make sure you're logged in via Auth0
- Check that your user has admin permissions in Auth0
- Verify your `.env` file has correct Auth0 credentials
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

### Auth0 login not working

- Verify your Auth0 domain, client ID, and audience in `.env` file
- Check that `localhost:3000` is allowed in your Auth0 application settings
- See `AUTH0_SETUP.md` for detailed configuration

## Security Notes

- Auth0 handles token management automatically
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Auth0 tokens are cached securely by the Auth0 SDK
- Admin operations require valid authentication
- All API calls include the Authorization header automatically
- The session persists across page refreshes
